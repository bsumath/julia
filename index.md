Julia Fractal Drawing Program
=============================
This program is a specialized tool for the study of various dynamical systems. It was developed by Rich Stankewitz of the Ball State University (BSU) Mathematical Sciences department.

Julia is designed to draw the following types of sets in the complex plane:

1. Julia sets of a function.
2. Julia sets of rational semigroups.
3. Attractor sets of an Iterated Function System (IFS).
4. Iterates of a seed value under any of the allowable map types.
5. Postcritical sets (of finite order) of any function or semigroup of the allowable map types.
6. Forward and Inverse images (using any of the allowable map types) of the above sets or any sets imported into Julia.


Requirements
------------
Julia will run on systems with the following:

* Java Runtime Environment version 6 or greater (JRE 8 recommended)
* An OpenGL graphics card.
* Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or Solaris operating systems
* To draw large sets, at least 2gb of RAM is needed.


Installation and Use
--------------------
Julia can be launched as a Java Web Start Application:

* [Julia - v2.2.0 (stable)]({{ "/jnlp/julia.jnlp" | prepend: site.baseurl }})


Contributors
------------
Initial development of Julia was done by Team Motivity as a Software Engineering project for the BSU Computer Science department. Team Motivity was:

* Rich Stankewitz
* Wendy Conatser
* Trey Butz
* Yun Li
* Kristopher Hart

Further development of Julia has been done by:

* Ben Dean
* Wendy Conatser
* Sida Qiu
